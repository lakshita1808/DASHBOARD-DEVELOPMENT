# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on building an interactive data visualization dashboard using Power BI, which is a powerful business intelligence tool. The purpose of the dashboard is to convert raw sales data into meaningful and easy-to-understand insights through visuals like charts, graphs, and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). With the help of visuals and interactivity, users can explore different aspects of the data without needing to scroll through large tables or spreadsheets.

The dataset used in this project is named Details.csv. It contains sales records from different product categories such as Clothing, Electronics, and Furniture. The columns in the dataset include Category, Sub-Category, Payment Mode, Quantity, Amount, and Profit. These fields help in analyzing how much was sold, how customers preferred to pay, which category earned more profit, and how much quantity of each sub-category was sold.

The dashboard contains several useful visuals:

KPI Cards are added to the top of the dashboard to show the total Amount, Profit, and Quantity. These give a quick summary of the overall performance.
A Bar Chart shows the Profit by Category, which helps identify which category (e.g., Electronics or Furniture) contributes the most to the business.
A Donut Chart displays the Profit Share by Category, helping users quickly understand the percentage contribution of each category to the total profit.
A Line Chart shows the Average Profit by Category, giving a better view of profitability per transaction or per product.
A Column Chart displays Quantity Sold by Sub-Category, showing which types of products are more in demand.
A Horizontal Bar Chart shows Sales by Payment Mode, helping to understand customer preferences when paying.

Two Slicers are added to make the dashboard interactive. Users can filter the whole report by Category or by Payment Mode. For example, by selecting "Clothing" in the slicer, the charts will update to show only data related to that category.
To make the dashboard visually appealing, custom background colors and shapes were added. A clean title, section formatting, and a footer with the creator’s name help give it a professional touch. The dashboard layout is neat, balanced, and user-friendly.
This project demonstrates the power of data visualization. Instead of going through raw data in a spreadsheet, users can now look at charts and graphs to understand trends, compare category performance, and gain insights quickly. It is especially helpful for managers and decision-makers who want to monitor performance without going into technical details.
All files used in this project — the Power BI file (.pbix), the dataset (Details.csv), and a screenshot of the dashboard — are uploaded to GitHub. The .pbix file can be downloaded and opened in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard further.

In summary, this project shows how tools like Power BI can turn data into powerful stories through interactive dashboards that are not only informative but also easy to use and visually impressive.
